CSS(cascading style sheets) is used to design/style the web page. They were introduced in 1994.
To design a website well,
we need to concentrate three things:
   -- eye-friendly colours
   -- fonts
   -- layout

1. How to Link CSS to HTML?
We can link CSS to HTML in three ways
  i. inline CSS:
     we can apply styles in html elements opening tag , style as a attribute.
     <h1 style="background-color: aqua;color: red;">
        Happy Children's Day
    </h1>
    /* create paragraph that says happy Children's day 
    and apply inline css for background-color and color properties */
  ii. Internal CSS:
    we can apply styles to any element/elements using 
    style as a element
    syntax: 
    selector
    {
       //properties
    }
eg:<style>
        h1
        {
          background-color: blue;
          color: white;
        }
    </style>
/* create 4 paragraphs with some dummy data and apply same background-color and color properties to all paragraphs using internal CSS */

iii. External CSS:
we can create separate CSS file and attach to HTML using link tag.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
